Guy, didn't wanna make this public until you approved, so that's why it's private and you're an invited collaborator. You can do as you see fit. Just multiple people have mentioned trying to get some sort of database together, thought I'd go ahead and get it done. 


List of EAC games and whether they're known to be working with wine


This is to sort of manage the chaos of a couple hundred people testing around 100 games, so we can find any trouble areas, and determine the cause. 

"Working" does **not** mean "works for everyone with no issues." This list is to focus on EAC issues, and issues with regard to people frogging their wineprefixes and whatnot aren't really relevant. If a large number of people can't get a listed-as-working game to work with known-working wineprefixes, then it can be designated as tentative, and can be focused on in more detail going forward.


Please don't throw this all over the linuxnet (r/linux_gaming, lutris forums, gamingonlinux, etc.) Obviously I can't stop you, but the more random people that've been on Linux for 3 days that show up trying to run this wine-eac, the more chaotic it gets for Guy, Blitzcrank, Josh, TKG, GE, and the rest of the guys. 

If you have tested a new game and it works, go ahead and edit the list and submit a PR. Anyone that wants to actually help maintain this let me know and I can add you as a collaborator.
